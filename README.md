# Python-Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock Paper Scissors, classic!

## Getting started

> Make sure you have Python 3 and pipenv installed.

## Go to the directory with the Pipfile and run

> ```pipenv install```

### After the install completes, run

> ```pipenv shell```
This will get you into the virtual environment. At this point, you should be able to run Python 3 by just running python:

> $ python --version
Python 3.6.5
You can exit the virtual environment by typing exit.
